title: OIDC Back-Channel Logout
sidebar_label: Back-Channel Logout
---

The Back-Channel Logout implements [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)
and can be used to notify clients about session termination at the OpenID Provider. This guide will explain how
back-channel logout is implemented inside ZITADEL and gives some usage examples.

:::info
Back-Channel Logout is currently an experimental [beta](/docs/support/software-release-cycles-support#beta) feature.
Be sure to enable it on the [feature API](#feature-api) before using it.
We highly recommend also enabling the `webkey` feature on your instance. This will prevent issues with automatic key rotation.
:::

In this guide we assume your already familiar with getting and validation token. You should already have a good
understanding on the following topics before starting with this guide:

- Integrate your app with the [OIDC flow](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/login-users) to obtain tokens
- [Claims](/docs/apis/openidoauth/claims)
- [Scope](/docs/apis/openidoauth/scopes)
- Audience

## Concept

ZITADEL provides the possibility for OpenID Connect clients to be notified about the session termination, for example
if a user signs out from another client using the same SSO session.
This allows the client to also invalidate the user's session without the need for an active browser session.

![Authentication and Back-Channel Logout Flow](/img/guides/back-channel-logout/back-channel-logout-flow.png)

1. When an unauthenticated user visits your application,
2. you will create an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.
3. The Authorization Server (ZITADEL) will send an HTTP 302 to the user's browser, which will redirect them to the login UI.
4. The user will have to authenticate using the demanded auth mechanics.
5. Your application will be called on the registered callback path (redirect_uri) for the authorization code exchange.
See [OIDC Flow](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/login-users) for more details.
On successful exchange, an SSO session will be created.
6. If the user opens another application,
7. the application will also create an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.
8. ZITADEL can then reuse the existing SSO session and will not ask the user to authenticate again and directly return the code for exchange.
See [OIDC Flow](/docs/guides/integrate/login/oidc/login-users) again for details.
9. At a later point, the user signs out from one of the applications, in this case the second one.
10. The application will redirect the user to the end_session endpoint.
11. ZITADEL will terminate the SSO session and redirect the user back to the application's post_logout_redirect_uri.
The application can delete the local session.
12. ZITADEL will also send a back-channel logout request to every registered application with previously opened sessions.
The application can then invalidate the user's session without the need for an active browser session.

### Indicating Support

As required by the [specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html#BCSupport), ZITADEL
will advertise the `backchannel_logout_supported` and `backchannel_logout_session_supported`
on the discovery endpoint once the feature flag is enabled.
The latter boolean indicates, that ZITADEL will provide a session ID (`sid`) claim as part of the logout token. This
provides the possibility to match the exact SSO session, which was terminated.

### Client

To enable the back-channel logout on a client, they simply need to register a `backchannel_logout_uri` as part of their
configuration, e.g. [creating an OIDC application](https://zitadel.com/docs/apis/resources/mgmt/management-service-add-oidc-app).

As soon as the URI is set, every new authorization request will register a back-channel notification to be sent once
the session is terminated by a user sign out.

## Back-Channel Request

When the session is terminated, ZITADEL will send back-channel logout requests asynchronously to every registered
client of the corresponding session.
The request is an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST request to the registered URI including a `logout_token`
parameter in the body.
Please be aware that body *may* contain other values in addition to logout_token. Values that are not understood by the
implementation *must* be ignored.

### Logout Token

The `logout_token` sent in the request is a JWT similar to an ID Token.

:::info
Note however, that a Logout Token will never contain a `nonce` claim, to make sure it cannot be used as an ID Token.

The following Claims are used within the Logout Token:

| Claim  | Example                                                        | Description                                                                                                                          |

#### Validation

Verify the Logout Token the same way you verify an ID Token including signature validation, issuer, audience, expiration and issued at time claim checks.
Make sure that either a subject (`sub`) and / or a session ID (`sid`) is present in the token to identify the user or its session.
Also, check that the `events` claim contains the `http://schemas.openid.net/event/backchannel-logout` value.
Optionally, you can also verify that the TokenID (`jti`) has not been used before.

For details on how to validate the logout token, please refer to the [OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html#Validation).
